# Sentiment-Analysis-Ml-Algorithm

The "Sentiment Analysis" project focuses on analyzing user reviews of musical instruments to determine the sentiment expressed in these reviews. Below is a detailed overview of the project's key components and steps:

Introduction
The goal of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on user reviews of musical instruments. Sentiment analysis involves classifying the sentiments expressed in the text as positive, neutral, or negative.

Data Preprocessing
Loading Data: The dataset contains various features about user reviews on musical instruments.
Text Cleaning: This involves removing unnecessary elements like stopwords, punctuation, and special characters from the reviews.
Tokenization: Splitting the text into individual words or tokens.
Lemmatization/Stemming: Reducing words to their base or root form to standardize them.
Feature Extraction
TF-IDF: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency is used to convert textual data into numerical features, which represent the importance of words in the reviews.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Unigrams and Bigrams: Analyzing single words and pairs of words that frequently appear in positive, neutral, and negative reviews.
Trigrams: Analyzing three-word combinations to understand the context and common phrases used in reviews.
Model Building
Classification Models: Various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are trained and evaluated.
Cross-Validation: Using 10-Fold Cross Validation to assess the performance of the models.
Model Tuning: Fine-tuning the best-performing model, which is Logistic Regression in this case.
Model Evaluation
Accuracy and F1 Score: Evaluating the models based on accuracy and F1 Score to ensure they perform well on both training and test datasets.
Confusion Matrix: Analyzing the confusion matrix to understand the distribution of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Visualization
Word Clouds: Visualizing the most common words in positive, neutral, and negative reviews using word clouds.
Bar Plots: Displaying the frequency of unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams in different sentiments using bar plots.
Conclusion
The dataset predominantly features reviews related to guitars and other string-based instruments, indicating a high customer interest in these items.
Logistic Regression was found to be the most effective model for this sentiment analysis task, providing high accuracy and F1 Score.
Recommendations include considering more advanced cross-validation methods like Stratified K-Fold and data scaling for further improvements.
Sources of Learning
Articles and Notebooks: Several resources and articles related to text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and machine learning techniques were referenced and found useful.
By following these steps, the project successfully builds a robust sentiment analysis model that can accurately predict the sentiments of user reviews on musical instruments
